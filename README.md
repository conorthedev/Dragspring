# Dragspring
**Dragspring is the successor to PullToRespring, it adds a quick respring action to the Settings App to respring with ease.**

### Features
- Optimised for the latest iOS
    - Dragspring looks the best on the latest iOS versions, it uses newer APIs to ensure that you are getting the best viewing experience when using it, allowing for custom spinner subtitles and more.
- Custom commands
    - You can do other things than just respring! You can change the command used in the Dragspring Preferences
    - You can chose from the 3 preset commands, or you can enter a custom one!
        - You can also run multiple commands, like this: ``uicache -a && sbreload``!
- Custom subtitles
    - Dragspring allows you to put custom text before the action is running and while the action is running. 
    - This could be something like 'Respring?' and 'Respringing...' or 'UICache?' and 'Running UICache!'
